# **Factorial QA Testing**

  For testing purposes I have picked a web application developed for helping QA testing which can be accessed through the following link : (https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com/) . The application has the purpose of calculating the factorial of a number entered by the user.
  
  Due to the fact that there was no documentation provided for this application, the test planning was not based on any therefore I have decided to do exploratory testing instead.
  
  ## Summary
  
  The test plan performed on this application is composed of the following suits of test cases :
  - UI/front-end testing : all the elements of the user interface (Page Header, Input Field, Button, "Terms and Conditions" hyperlink, "Privacy" hyperlink, Footer hyperlink) were tested in order for them to be correct, relevant to the theme and interactible
  - functionality testing : the Input Field, Button and hyperlinks were tested to verify that they are functional and they work as they should
  - validation/negative testing : various types of inputs were tested to make sure the correct result/error message is displayed upon calculating

### Website link
  
   The first test I performed was making sure that the link is functional. After being able to access the website, I checked if the Website Title is correct and consistent with the purpose of the application.
   
   During this step I have also noticed that the Website does not have a personalized icon and the stardard one is shown instead.
   
   Performing the test run for this suite: 
   - Website link is functional : I was able to access the provided link - 
   - Website Title is correct and relevant to the theme : 
   
   ### User Interface
   
   After accessing the website, the next step was verifying that the UI elements load up correctly and there is nothing missing or showing inappropriately. The following elements were verified : Page Header, Input Field, Button, "Terms and Conditions" hyperlink, "Privacy" hyperlink, Footer hyperlink. I checked if all are written correctly, the text is relevant to the theme and that they are all interactible.
   During this step I encountered
   

- ui/front-end 
- functionalitate
- edge-case
- negative-testing


- reported issues
- icon missing
