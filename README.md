# **Factorial QA Testing**

  For testing purposes I have picked a web application developed for helping QA testing which can be accessed through the following link : https://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com/ . The application has the purpose of calculating the factorial of a number entered by the user.
  Due to the fact that there was no documentation provided for this application, the test planning was not based on any therefore I have decided to do exploratory testing instead.
   The first test I performed was making sure that the link is functional. After being able to access the website, I checked if the Website Title is correct and consistent with the purpose of the application.
   
   ## User Interface
   After accessing the website, the next step was verifying that the UI elements load up correctly and there is nothing missing or showing inappropriately. During this step the following elements were verified : Page Header, Input Field, Button, "Terms and Conditions" hyperlink, "Privacy" hyperlink, Footer hyperlink. I checked if all are written correctly, the text is relevant to the theme and that they are all interactible.
